# ARM processors
This is a release Candidate 4 from Python 3.13.0 Beta release

We have yet to spend time on writing a shell script installer for ARM processors such as 
all the ARM on Windows and M1/M2 Mac devices. We dont guarantee that it will work for MAC.

This is most recent version of Python 3.13.0 Beta release. When it comes to installing the universal pkg file to ARM
processors, we have yet to test this release on an M1 and M2 Apple and Windows ARM devices.
