# ARM processors
This is a release Candidate 3 from Python 3.13.0 Alpha release

We have yet to spend time on writing a shell script installer for ARM processors such as 
all the ARM on Windows and M1/M2 Mac devices. The default shell installer for MAC can only
be used for Intel Mac devices and wont work on ARM: M1, M2 Apple devices.  

This is most recent version of Python 3.13.0 Alpha release 3. When it comes to installing the universal pkg file to ARM
processors, we have yet to test this release on an M1 and M2 Apple laptop.
