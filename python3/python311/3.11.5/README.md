# ARM processors
We have yet to spend time on writing a shell script installer for ARM processors such as 
all the ARM on Windows and M1/M2 Mac devices. The default shell installer for MAC can only
be used for Intel Mac devices and wont work on ARM/M1/M2 mac devices.  

This is most recent version of Python 3.11.x. When it comes to installing the universal pkg file to ARM
processors, we've tested this on a M1 ARM laptop device. it was deem functional. 
We recommend that you should run it on a spare M1 or M2 machine and see if you could activate the python3
executable /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/
