# ARM processors

We have spendt time on writing a shell script installer for ARM processors on Windows and
M1/M2 Mac devices. We wont be able to test the ARM Installer for Windows due to lacking
a ARM windows hardware to test. If you owned a Surface pro tablet, running the non-ARM 
installer should work for you. If you are bold, you can certainly try the experimental 
Python installer for Windows. 

There is also a Disclaimer from the Python Community on their ARM Python Install for Windows (Experimental).  

The default shell PKG UNIVERSAL installer for MAC will work for both Intel Mac devices and ARM (M1/M2) devices.  

This is most recent version of Python 3.12.x. When it comes to installing the universal pkg file to ARM
processors, we've tested this on a M1 ARM laptop device. it was deem functional. 
We recommend that you should run it on a spare M1 or M2 machine and see if you could activate the python3
executable /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/
