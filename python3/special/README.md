# AMD, Intel x86, x86_64 windows ONLY

This is the installation of one of the three of the most recent releases of Python on the
Intel/AMD x86, x86_64 with python 3.9.x, 3.10.x and 3.11.x.

This is kind of experimental on my part to write a CMD script to install one of the three most recent releases
of Python on the Windows 10/11 platform. 

We wont be supporting ARM on the installation of Python 3.10.x, 3.11.x on the windows OS, since we will be supporting it starting 
with Python 3.12.x only.  Simple download the windows Python 3.12.x CMD script to install the ARM windows Installation script.
