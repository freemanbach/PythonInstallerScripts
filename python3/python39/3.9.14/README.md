# ARM processors
We have yet to spend time on writing a shell script installer for ARM processors such as 
all the ARM on Windows and M1/M2 Mac devices. The default shell installer for MAC can only
be used for Intel Mac devices and wont work on ARM/M1/M2 mac devices.  

# Python Version
This is the last version of Python 3.9.x where the community will end support except for security updates.
There is no more installer for this version, so therefore we will stop with Python 3.9.13.
