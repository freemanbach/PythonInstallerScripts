# PythonInstallerScripts
Automatic Scripts to remote install a fresh copy of various versions of Python Starting with 3.9.x, 3.10.x and 3.11.x. 

We are also well aware that Python 3.12.x will be coming out sometime in the next 6 to 8 months. Once this version has been released, we will be adding a remote CMD script to our GITHUB repository. We will only be focuing this installation script on x86 and x86_64 or Intel base i(N) series CPUs as well as AMD Ryzen series CPUs. Unfortunately,  we dont currently own a Windows machine which supports a ARM processor.  We would not be able to support ARM on Windows anytime soon.

Yet, there is also no direct support from the Python Community on a ARM version running on MAC OSX (M1, M2, M(N)). There is a Universal Version
of Python running on MAC, where we have a remote Shell script to pull this PKG package directly to a MAC machine on both x86_64 and ARM in the meantime.
